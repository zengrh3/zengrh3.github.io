I am a graduated student from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uggVcIAAAAJ). My research primarily focused on **Machine Learning on Graphs**. Currently, I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor [Zaiqiao Meng](https://mengzaiqiao.github.io/) on projects related to **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Specifically, my work focuses on: (1) Combining Bayesian graphical models with variational inference to enhance graph representation learning. (2) Investigating memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents. (3) Integrating knowledge graphs to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLM performance for knowledge-intensive tasks.
