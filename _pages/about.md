I am a graduated student from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research interests mainly focus on **Machine Learning on Graphs** and **Large Language Models**. In particular, I am primarily working on 1) Combining Bayesian graphical models and variational inference methods to enhance graph representation learning. 2) Studying memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents. 3) Exploring the integration of knowledge graphs to enhance RAG and LLMs for improved knowledge-intensive tasks.
